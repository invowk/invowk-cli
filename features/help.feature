Feature: Help flag
  In order to know invowk's features
  As an invowk user
  I must see info about possible usages when executing the root command with the commonly used '-h' flag

  Background:
    Given an open TTY

  Scenario: Show help information
    When I successfully run "--help"
    Then the terminal output should contain:
    """
    invowk is a code execution & sharing engine exposed as an user-extensible CLI.

    Why is it an 'execution engine'?
    Because invowk helps you run code/scripts encapsulated as custom user-made
    commands! Such commands can be written as/in:
    - shell scripts (e.g.: bash, zsh, cmd, powershell)
    - dynamic languages (e.g.: python, js/node.js, ruby)
    - compiled languages (e.g.: java, go, rust, c/c++)
    They can be run against the host machine or a Docker container, all in the
    most seamless fashion.

    Why is it a 'sharing engine'?
    Because invowk helps you import/export custom user-made commands so that you
    can easily run other people's code/automations/ideas and vice-versa!
    We even have several curated custom commands that you can try out-of-the-box.

    Why is it an 'user-extensible CLI'?
    Because invowk is a kind of 'meta-CLI': it is designed so that its users can
    extend it with custom commands that add the real value to the CLI and invowk
    ecosystem! It also makes receiving (via flags or fancy interactive prompts)
    and validating inputs a complete breeze.

    Usage:
      invowk [command]

    Available Commands:

  Scenario: Show Markdown text
    When I successfully run "prettymd"
    Then the TUI output should contain the content from "prettymd.txt", which renders to:
